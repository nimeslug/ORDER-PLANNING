# ORDER-PLANNING
 This C++ program simulates the order fulfillment process for a company with 10 dealers. It generates random orders, stores them in a file, and randomizes the order of dealer visits. The program calculates the total orders, updates the stock after fulfilling the orders, and saves the results in a file. It demonstrates the use of pointers, file handling, and randomization.
